            <p>Ask, why was your client stopped in the first place? Was there a lawful basis for the encounter with
                police? A traffic stop is lawful only if the officer has probable cause to believe an infraction has
                occurred or has reasonable suspicion of a crime. <i>State v. Matthews</i>, 320 Or 398 (1994). An
                officer’s subjective belief that an infraction has occurred is objectively reasonable if, and only if,
                the facts as the officer perceives them actually satisfy the elements of a traffic infraction. <i>State
                    v. Gordon</i>, 273 Or App 495 (2015). If the DUII stems from an illegal stop file a suppression
                motion (see Chapter 7).

        <p><b>1. Driving a Vehicle</b>
        </p>
        <p>a. Although the term “drives” is not defined under 813.010, the word is “construed as requiring that the
            vehicle be in motion in order for the offense to be committed.” <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Minow,+246+Or+App+179,++%282011&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=9708850174613394981&amp;scilh=0"><i>State
                    v. Minow</i>, 246 Or App 179, 184-185 (2011)</a>. The terms “drives” (ORS 813.010) and “operates”
            (ORS 813.100) are synonymous. The term “operation” is defined in ORS 801.370 as “any operation, towing,
            pushing, movement or otherwise propelling.” Nothing indicates that this definition not be applied in the
            context of DUII. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Cruz,+121+Or+App+241,+%281993&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=14465753892105674362&amp;scilh=0"><i>State

            (1971), and <i>Moe v. MVD</i>, 133 Or App 75(1995). The slightest amount of movement is sufficient. Rolling
            forward one inch in a parking space is driving. Multiple impaired people pushing a car stuck in the snow are
            all subject to DUII.
        </p>
        <p>b. Driving can be inferred from the circumstances. While having the engine running does not constitute
            “driving” under the statute, a jury could reasonably infer that the defendant drove to that location. <a

            <p>It is not uncommon to come across this type of fact pattern: the police arrive on scene to a driver
                slumped over the steering wheel. The officers tap on the window to wake the driver up. Usually a police
                cruiser or two will be in position to box the car in. Police then reach inside and pull the driver out
                of the car. Once the driver’s foot is pulled off the brake, the car lurches forward. Was there a
                voluntary act to propel the car? Did the driver merely attempt to drive?

            whether the premises are publicly or privately owned and whether or not a fee is charged for the use of the
            premises.” The term “premises open to the public” should be defined so as to achieve its primary purposes,

                certainly included as premises open to the public for use of a motor vehicle. So too is a driveway that
                can be accessed from a public street. But did your client get stopped by police while spinning cookies
                in the athletic field of the local high school? Your client may have other problems, but the athletic
                field is most likely not a premises open to the public for the use of a motor vehicle. Other common
                premises that may not be open to the public include private driveways, ranches, and fenced-off private

        <p>a. The state may show a defendant committed the offense of driving under the influence of intoxicants by
            proving the defendant drove with a blood alcohol content of .08% or higher as shown by chemical analysis.
            ORS 813.010(1)(a). This is known as the “per se” level of impairment and prohibits use of the “hold your
            liquor” defense. Your client may still be found guilty of DUII even if they are not “under the influence.”
            The state may also prove the defendant violated the statute by driving under the influence of intoxicants.
            ORS 813.010(1)(b)-(c).
        </p>
        <p>b. The relevant point in time for a defendant’s blood alcohol content is the time of driving, not the time of
            the breath or blood test. Retrograde extrapolation may be used to show a defendant’s blood alcohol content
            at the time they were driving. The Oregon Supreme Court explicitly found that an expert may project
            backwards from blood alcohol content at the time of a breath or blood test to the likely blood alcohol
            content at the time of the driving. An expert may testify about the rate of dissipation through retrograde
            extrapolation. <i>See</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"

            their scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge assist the trier of fact to understand evidence?
            Think of this as a two-step process: First, the state must qualify their witness as an expert. This will
            almost always be someone from the Oregon State Police crime lab who has been trained on how to testify as to
            their qualification Second, through the expert the state must show the scientific BAC evidence meets the

            <p>This can present an opportunity for the defense if the prosecutor and their witness are not prepared to

            </p>
            <p>d. Be on alert for the many ways the state may try and introduce evidence regarding a person’s BAC at the
                time of driving. Making a motion in limine pretrial to cut off this line of testimony ahead of time is
                generally a good idea. This helps limit the possibility that the officer as witness may ring this bell
                in front of the jury.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>i. Generally, a police officer cannot testify that a person’s actions correlate to a certain BAC. <a

        <p>iii. The state also cannot rely solely on an inference that because a person’s BAC was above .08 at the time
            of the breath test the person must have also been above .08 at an earlier point when the driving occurred.

        <p>f. Exigent Circumstances: Why is everyone in such a hurry?
        </p>
        <p>i. The Oregon Supreme Court has recognized that the evanescent nature of alcohol in the blood gives rise to
            exigent circumstances. The court has shifted to an emphasis on the exigency caused by the dissipation of
            alcohol rather than whether or not a warrant could have been obtained in a timely fashion. <a rel="nofollow"

        <p>iii. A warrantless entry into a home to arrest a suspected drunk driver may be allowed if the entry into the

        </p>
        <p>i. A request for a BAC sample is a search and seizure for purposes of Article I, section 9. <a rel="nofollow"
                class="external text"
                href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2673885208404789717&amp;q=State+v.+Banks,+364+Or+332+(2019)&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38"><i>State

            <span class="label">Practice Tip</span>
            <p>Did your client refuse the breath test? Did the officer exhibit any type of bias against your client?
                Often a person may have legitimate reasons for not wanting to cooperate with the police. Explore those
                reasons with your client. Officer bias is never collateral. <i>State v. Tyon</i>, 226 Or App 428 (2009).

        </div>

        <p>Did your client request an independent breath or blood test <i>after</i> taking the breath test requested by
            police? If so, did the police afford your client a reasonable opportunity to take such a test as set forth
            in ORS 813.150? Though not particularly helpful, <i>see generally State v. Davis</i>, 254 Or App 387 (2012),
            and <i>State v. Darlin</i>, 122 Or App 172 (1993). I did litigate and win this issue in Multnomah County in
            front of the Honorable Henry Kantor several years back. <i>State v. Hicks</i>, Mult Cir Co No 130647216. It
            is not often the right set of facts comes along, but make what you can of them.

        <p>Did the state bring the Intoxilyzer certificates to trial? Both the Intoxilyzer 8000 and 5000 are required to
            be certified for accuracy every 90 days. ORS 813.160(1)(b)(C), OAR 257-30-0100. The Intoxilyzer certificates
            are not testimonial evidence. <i>State v.</i> <i>Bergin</i>, 231 Or App 36 (2009). Is the officer qualified
            to operate the Intoxilyzer machine? OAR 257-30-0080. See also ORS 813.322(2), if officer testifies that they
            are qualified to run the machine, the burden shifts to defense to present evidence that the officer is not
            so qualified.

        <p>h. Reduction to .05 Percent
        </p>
        <p>In 2019 Utah became the first state to reduce the legal driving limit to 0.05%. In January of 2019 Senator
            Peter Courtney introduced Senate Bill 7 to do the same in Oregon, but the bill died under pressure from the
            liquor and restaurant industries. The Oregon legislature will likely continue to consider this idea, which
            has the support of Governor Kate Brown. Australia, most of Europe, and Japan have enacted 0.05% as the legal
            limit.

        <p><b>5. Under the Influence of Intoxicants</b>

            an intoxicating liquor, a controlled substance, an inhalant, or any combination of intoxicating liquor,
            inhalant and a controlled substance. ORS 813.010(1)(b)-(c). The state must allege any such theory in the
            charging instrument. ORS 813.010(2).
        </p>
        <p>b. A person is considered under the influence of intoxicants if their physical and mental faculties are

        <p>Obviously the stakes are much higher when your client is facing a felony DUII charge. In these cases, your
            client has much more at risk, including the potential for prison time, a lifetime driver’s license
            revocation, and being labeled a “Felon.” Before representing someone facing this criminal charge,
            familiarize yourself with the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission’s Sentencing Guidelines Rules and consult
            experienced practitioners who have tried these cases before. The facts, aside from the prior convictions,
            will be like every other misdemeanor DUII case you have defended before. Do not let the label of “felony

            in a motor vehicle and the person has, at least three times in the 10 years prior to the date of the current
            offense, been convicted of, or been found to be within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for an act

            controlled substance, an inhalant or any combination thereof.

        <p>One of the most important things counsel can do for a felony DUII defendant is to exclude, suppress, or
            otherwise nullify the prior conviction so those priors are no longer an element of the felony DUII. For
            purposes of the current DUII charge being a felony, the prior convictions are measured from the date of
            <i>conviction</i> of the priors to the date of <i>incident</i> on the current charge.

        <p>To be used as an element of the crime of DUII, each prior conviction must meet the Oregon standard for a
            valid conviction. Although uncounseled pleas are becoming far less frequent, they still occur. Under <a

                    v. McKenzie,</i> 195 Or App 318 (2004<i>)</i></a>, the Court of Appeals found that Oregon law

            awareness by the defendant of the risks of self-representation.” In Oregon, under <a rel="nofollow"

            the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the conviction is invalid, then the burden

        <p>A conviction is “invalid” if it is unlawful: obtained in violation of the right to counsel, jury, or the

            days’–notice provision probably does not apply to an argument that a conviction is not for a statutory
            counterpart of DUII or is not the defendant.

        <p><b>2. Other Jurisdictions</b>
        </p>
        <p>Any out-of-state prior conviction must meet the same requirements of a “statutory counterpart” to Oregon’s
            DUII to be counted as a prior conviction. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Ortiz,+202+Or+App+695+%25282005%2529&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=15492066100522438572&amp;scilh=0"><i>State
                    v. Ortiz,</i> 202 Or App 695 (2005)</a>. At the end of 2019, the Oregon Supreme Court provided
            clarification on what constitutes a statutory counterpart in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6911857466307072683&amp;q=State+v.+Guzman,+366+Or+18+(2019)&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38"><i>State
                    v. Guzman</i>, 366 Or 18 (2019)</a>. Guzman restricts the prior court rulings on what counts as a
            counterpart and uses a “close element matching” process to make the determination. Examine the out of state
            prior conviction to see how the elements match the Oregon legal standard. The standard in Colorado of
            driving while impaired to the slightest degree was sufficiently dissimilar to Oregon’s
            noticeable/perceptible degree standard and therefore did not count as a prior conviction. Likewise, a Kansas
            statute that said driving or attempting to drive while impaired was not the statutory counterpart to Oregon
            because attempted DUII is not the same as DUII in Oregon.
        </p>
        <p>A conviction for a non-DUII offense, such as a “wet reckless,” would not be a statutory counterpart.

            admitted a court-martial conviction, explaining that “the validity of

            was not admissible under either standard.
        </p>
        <p>Cases like <i>Molette</i> and <i>McKenzie</i> show how important it is for defense counsel to understand the
            out-of-state record and to choose how to attack it. <i>Molette,</i> a post-conviction case, found counsel to
            have been ineffective in failing to attack an out-of-state conviction.
        </p>
        <p>If one or more of defendant’s out-of-state convictions is not, or is arguably not, a statutory counterpart,
            that should probably be raised as a motion in limine prior to trial. If that motion is unsuccessful, it
            appears to be a jury question. See Appendix C for a list of statutory counterparts that have been litigated.

    <div class="editableSection mw-collapsible mw-made-collapsible" id="mw-customcollapsible-28">
        <p>Field sobriety tests as a component of BUII cases are often overlooked by both the police and defense
            attorneys. The National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA), in a successful grant
            application to the U.S. Coast Guard, noted the following:
        </p>
        <p>A battery of SFSTs was validated for traffic enforcement over two decades ago and since has become accepted
            nationwide as a means of demonstrating probable cause to arrest suspected impaired drivers. However, no such
            definitive validation has ever been conducted for SFSTs used on suspected impaired boat operators. In fact,
            the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) field sobriety test is the only truly validated SFST that can be
            administered to BUI suspects by marine law enforcement officer while afloat.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the lack of validation, many marine enforcement agencies routinely teach their officers to use these
            same highway-based SFSTs to screen boat operators, a purpose for which they were not validated. Over the
            course of the last 20 years literally thousands of BUI cases have been prosecuted using SFSTs designed and
            validated for use on highways, but borrowed as proxies for use on our waterways. Unfortunately, the primary
            battery of SFSTs approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA) for use in highway
            traffic enforcement is based on the assessment of human motor skills linked to one’s sense of balance.
        </p>
        <p>The grant application is full of excellent information that illustrates the weaknesses in BUII prosecutions,
            especially with regard to the administration of field sobriety tests. NASBLA’s application recounts the
            history of studies conducted concerning field sobriety tests in a marine environment, concluding with a
            description of the research to date:
        </p>
        <p>In 1993, Dr. Marceline Burns (“A Study of Field Sobriety Tests in the Marine Environment”), of the Southern
            California Research Institute, conducted a preliminary study in an attempt to evaluate a number of accepted
            field sobriety tests and their use in a marine environment. The results of this study indicated the
            Rhomberg-type tests of subtraction and backward counting variations were not alcohol-sensitive enough for
            use as FSTs. Three tests showed significant promise as on-boat FST and were identified as the finger to
            nose, 30-second time estimation and the skip alphabet. As a note, horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) was also
            evaluated in the marine environment, but because it is neural and not vestibular in origin (vestibular
            impairment may include dizziness, imbalance, vertigo, nausea, and fuzzy vision), there were no perceived
            issues in its use as an on-boat FST. Recently, HGN was validated for both sitting and prone positions, thus
            increasing its validity as an on-boat predictor of alcohol use in the marine environment.
        </p>
        <p>In 2011, after a three-year study funded by the Coast Guard, NASBLA – along with the SCRI – validated four
            seated field sobriety tests for use afloat. Four seated tests have been approved for detection of impairment
            (defined as BAC greater than or equal to .08%: <i>horizontal gaze nystagmus; finger to nose; palm pat, and
                hand coordination.</i>
        </p>
        <p>“<i>Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus</i> – The HGN test requires three separate checks, administered independently
            to each eye. Four or more clues indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.
        </p>
        <p><i>Finger to Nose</i> – The FTN test requires the subject to bring the tip of the index finger to touch the
            tip of the nose. It is performed with eyes closed and head tilted slightly back. Nine or more clues indicate
            impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.
        </p>
        <p><i>The Palm Pat</i> – The PP test requires the subjects to place one hand extended, palm up, out in front of
            them. The other hand is placed on top of the first with the palm facing down. The top hand rotates 180
            degrees and pats the bottom hand, alternating between the back of the hand and the palm of the hand. The
            bottom hand remains stationary. The subjects count out loud in relation with each pat. Two or more clues
            indicate impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.
        </p>
        <p><i>The Hand Count</i> – The HC test requires the subjects to perform a series of tasks with their hands. It
            is very loosely adapted from the Walk-And-Turn test performed on land. Three or more clues indicate
            impairment due to BAC greater than or equal to .08%.”

            chemical test, and upon refusal must ask for only “physical cooperation” and inform the individual of the
            consequences of a refusal. Refusal is deemed willful if a person is informed about rights and consequences
            concerning the test under ORS 830.505 and 830.545 and refuses to physically submit to the test. The
            legislation allows for a defense if the person provides documentation from a medical doctor stating they
            were physically unable to provide a sample at the time of the incident. The bill also adds a prohibition on
            boating under the influence of an inhalant.

        </p>
        <p>(a) Operating a boat under the influence of intoxicants is a crime in Oregon and the person is subject to
            criminal penalties if the test shows that the person is under the influence of intoxicants. If the person
            refuses the test or fails, evidence of the refusal or failure may also be offered against the person.

        <p>(b) The person fails the test if the test shows the person is under the influence of intoxicants under Oregon
            law.

        <p>(d) If the person is convicted of operating a boat while under the influence of intoxicants, the person is
            not eligible to apply for any certificate of title, registration or numbering and all certificates of title,
            registration and numbering necessary to lawfully operate a boat on Oregon waters shall be canceled for at

        <p>(e) After taking the test, the person shall have a reasonable opportunity, upon request, for an additional
            chemical test for blood alcohol content to be performed at the person’s own expense by a qualified
            individual of the person’s choosing.

        </p>
        <p>(1) Every person riding a bicycle upon a public way is subject to the provisions applicable to and has the
            same rights and duties as the driver of any other vehicle concerning operating on highways, vehicle
            equipment and abandoned vehicles, except:

        <p>(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section:
        </p>
        <p>(a) A bicycle is a vehicle for purposes of the vehicle code; and
        </p>
        <p>(b) When the term ““vehicle”” is used the term shall be deemed to be applicable to bicycles.
        </p>
        <p>(3) The provisions of the vehicle code relating to the operation of bicycles do not relieve a bicyclist or
            motorist from the duty to exercise due care. [1983 c.338 §§697; 1985 c.16 §§335]

        <p>This application of the DUII statute to bikes implicates the standards that the state must meet in order to
            prove a DUII case; either a BAC of .08% or greater at the time of operation of the bicycle or that the
            bicyclist is under the influence of 1) intoxicating liquor, 2) a controlled substance, or 3) a combination
            of alcohol and a controlled substance such that the person’s physical or mental faculties are adversely
            affected by the intoxicants to a noticeable and perceptible degree.

            amends ORS Chapter 814 to permit a bicyclist approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign or
            flashing red light to proceed through the intersection or make a turn without stopping if the bicyclist
            slows to a safe speed. SB 998 creates new Class D traffic violations of improper entry into an intersection
            controlled by a flashing red light or a stop sign. A violation occurs if a bicyclist fails to yield to
            traffic within the intersection, disobeys a flagger or officer, fails to exercise care to avoid an accident
            or fails to yield right of way to a pedestrian.

        </p>
        <p>By the very terms of the statute, implied consent does <i>not</i> apply to bicycles. If you receive a police
            report where the officer walks through the IC paperwork with your client then gets them to take the breath
            test, the client is entitled to suppression of the BAC results. <i>State v. Woodruff</i>, <i>supra</i>,

        <p>Similarly, a person under arrest for a DUII-Bicycle can refuse the breath test and there will not be a one

        <p>Even if you receive no IC paperwork in the police report, it is worth asking your client whether there were

            breath or blood test. Since IC does not apply to bicycles, there is no license sanction for refusing the

        <p><i>State v. Woodruff</i> lays the groundwork for the argument that if a statute refers to “vehicle,” it will
            apply to bicycles. See Reckless Driving <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"

            the bicycles will not fall under the statute. See Implied Consent.
        </p>
        <p>However, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=State+v.+Potter,+185+Or+App+81+%282002&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,38&amp;case=11027246497969834870&amp;scilh=0"><span

            the “vehicle” vs. “motor vehicle” distinction as used in the Vehicle Code. In <i>Potter</i> a bicyclist was
            convicted under 811.130 for impeding traffic. This particular statute states that “a person commits the
            offense of impeding traffic if the person drives a motor vehicle or a combination of motor vehicles in a
            manner that impedes or blocks the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.”
        </p>
        <p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s denial of the bicyclist’s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal on
            the grounds that 811.130 did apply to bicycles, express reference to motor vehicles in the statute
            notwithstanding. In reaching this conclusion the court relied on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"

                    class="underline">801.026(6)</span></a> and 814.400.
        </p>
        <p>801.026 lays out a list of exemptions and exceptions to the vehicle code. Subsection (6) addresses bicycles:
        </p>
        <p>“6) Devices that are powered exclusively by human power are not subject to those provisions of the vehicle
            code that relate to vehicles. Notwithstanding this subsection, bicycles are generally subject to the vehicle

                        class="underline">PGE v. BOLI</span></i></a> analysis, the court concludes that, since
            801.026(6) exempts non-motorized vehicles from the Vehicle Code except for bicycles as provided in 814.400,
            the exception spelled out in 814.400(2)(that 814.400 does not apply when otherwise provided under the
            Vehicle Code) would be rendered meaningless were the court to find that 811.130 did not apply to bikes
            without the legislature specifically exempting bicycles from the coverage of 811.130.
        </p>
        <p>In other words, according to <i>Potter</i>, non-motorized vehicles are exempted from the vehicle code under
            801.026(6) except for bicycles. In general, bikes fall under the vehicle code by way of 814.400(1), unless
            according to 814.400(1)(b) “otherwise specifically provided under the vehicle code.” <i>Potter</i> seems to
            hold that bicycles always fall under all provisions of the vehicle code unless a particular statute
            specifically says it does not apply to bicycles.
        </p>
        <p>There is great conflict between <i>Potter</i> and <i>Woodruff</i>. Under the <i>Potter</i> reasoning, implied
            consent should apply to bicycles because it does not specifically exempt bicycles. Extending <i>Potter</i>
            to implied consent would lead to an absurd result because no operator’s license is necessary to ride a
            bicycle in Oregon, thus the implicit consent to take a breath test one gives to the state when they receive
            a driver’s license simply doesn’t exist when it comes to bicycles.
        </p>
        <p>Should this issue come up, another angle of attack is 814.400(1)(a), which provides that the vehicle code
            applies to bicycles except for “those provisions which by their very nature can have no application.” This
            subsection was not argued in <i>Potter</i>. Arguably, a provision in the code that refers specifically to
            motor vehicles cannot by its very nature apply to bicycles. Presumably, the legislature knows what it is
            doing when it uses the more specific language of “motor vehicle” versus simply “vehicle” in any given
            provision in the vehicle code.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that the conviction-based driver’s license suspension enumerated at ORS 813.400 does apply to a
            bicycle DUII. This also includes a permanent license revocation for a person convicted of felony DUII on a
            bicycle. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"

            balance. Were they riding along just fine prior to being stopped for not having a light on their bike?

        <p>A Person in a Motorized Wheelchair in a Crosswalk Is a Pedestrian and Not a Driver
        </p>
        <p>The court concludes that defendant—who was intoxicated while operating his motorized wheelchair in a
            crosswalk—was entitled to a judgment of acquittal for DUII. The court agrees with defendant that at the time
            he was operating his wheelchair in a crosswalk he was a pedestrian, not a driver subject to the vehicle
            code. The court acknowledges that the state’s argument, that defendant’s motorized wheelchair is a vehicle,
            is not without some merit. The vehicle expressly treats motorized vehicles as bicycles when they are
            operated in a bicycle lane or path. Accordingly, a person in a motorized wheelchair may be subject to DUII
            when operating in a bike lane. However, the vehicle code treats persons in wheelchairs as pedestrians for
            most other purposes and a person cannot be simultaneously a pedestrian and a driver. Therefore, when a
            person in a motorized wheelchair is traveling as a pedestrian in a crosswalk, he is not subject to DUII.
